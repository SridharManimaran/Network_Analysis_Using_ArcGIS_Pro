# Network_Analysis_Using_ArcGIS_Pro

Closest Facility Analysis

In this personal project focusing on network analysis in England, UK, specifically within the context of London's underground tube stations, ArcGIS Pro was utilized to conduct a detailed Closest Facility Analysis. The project involved the development of a point feature class with custom symbols representing both underground stations and residential area. London road data was consolidated into London boroughs using the Intersect tool and a definition query to extract major road features. A feature dataset and network dataset were established to load the London road feature class, facilitating the construction of the network analysis. By executing the Closest Facility Analysis, the project aimed to identify the nearest tube station from residential area, providing valuable insights into transportation accessibility across London.

Service Area Analysis

In continuation of the network analysis project in England, UK, focused on London's transportation infrastructure, a Service Area Analysis was conducted using ArcGIS Pro. Leveraging custom datasets comprising London underground stations and residential area, the analysis aimed to determine travel times from residential locations to tube stations. Walking durations of 10, 20, and 30 minutes were defined as intervals for the service area analysis. Additionally, a calculated field of 272.8 average person walking feet was incorporated as a time attribute to enhance the accuracy of the analysis. This Service Area Analysis offers valuable insights into pedestrian accessibility to public transportation nodes within the urban landscape of London, aiding in urban planning and transportation decision-making processes.
